# ankylosaurus

These are PKGBUILDs for AUR packages that I
[maintain and co-maintain](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?SeB=M&K=txtsd) at
the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/) using
[archosaur](https://github.com/txtsd/archosaur).

## Meaning

### Etymology

From the genus translingual Ankylosaurus, from Ancient Greek ἀγκύλος (ankúlos,
“crooked”) + σαῦρος (saûros, “lizard”); by surface analysis, ankylo- + -saurus.
The word was coined in 1908 by Brown, who did not give any explanation. It may
have been intended to refer to ankylosis, a medical condition in which bones
fuse and can cause a deformity. Ankylosaurs have some rear ribs fused to their
vertebrae.

### Noun

**ankylosaurus** (plural ankylosauri or ankylosauruses)

1. A large herbivorous dinosaur, of genus Ankylosaurus, that lived in the
Cretaceous period, noted for its heavy armor and club-like tail.
2. txtsd's favorite dinosaur.
3. Certainly, definitely, absolutely, not just for the AUR in the word.

## Credits

I'd like to think I did most of the work myself, but I stand on the shoulders
of giants:
